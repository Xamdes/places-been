## About

Create a website where you can keep track of all the places you've been. Each destination should be an object with multiple properties, like location, landmarks, time of year, notes, etc. Display those properties when a user clicks on a place's name. Complete the business logic for your place object first, before tackling the user interface. Additionally, make sure to include specifications with example input and output in your project's README.
